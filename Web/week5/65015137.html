            <h1>Wildfires on Hawaii's Maui island kill at least 6 as blazes force people to flee</h1>
            <p class="lead">UPDATED ON: AUGUST 10, 2023 / 3:26 AM </p>
            <p>At least six people were killed on the Hawaiian island of Maui as wind-fueled wildfires tore through the area, Maui Mayor Richard Bissen Jr. announced. Hundreds of buildings have also been damaged or destroyed. 
              <br><br>
              "We are still in a search and rescue mode, and so I don't know what will happen to that number," Bissen said.
              <br><br>
              The mayor didn't provide details about the circumstances surrounding the deaths, saying the death toll was confirmed just before a news conference with officials. He said several other people were unaccounted for but may be people who are in vehicles who haven't gone into a shelter.
              <br><br>
              Over 2,100 people were using the five shelters that have been opened on the island, and some of them — along with a number of hotels — lost power, Bissen said.

              Over 2,100 people were using the five shelters that have been opened on the island, and some of them — along with a number of hotels — lost power, Bissen said.

            <p>At least six people were killed on the Hawaiian island of Maui as wind-fueled wildfires tore through the area, Maui Mayor Richard Bissen Jr. announced. Hundreds of buildings have also been damaged or destroyed.

              "We are still in a search and rescue mode, and so I don't know what will happen to that number," Bissen said.
